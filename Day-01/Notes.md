                            📘 Day 1 – Cloud & Azure Basics
## 🌩️ What is Cloud?

***👉 Easy Explanation:***
> Cloud is just someone else’s computer (datacenters owned by Microsoft, Amazon, Google) that you rent instead of buying your own servers.

***👉 Industry Example:***
> Before cloud, companies used to buy physical servers, put them in a room, hire admins to maintain them. Costly + time consuming. Now with Azure (Microsoft’s cloud), you just log in, click a few buttons, and you get a VM, storage, or database running in minutes.

***👉 Key point to remember:***
> Cloud = on-demand, pay-as-you-go, scalable.

***👉 Interview Q: What is Cloud?***
> Answer: “Cloud is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, networking, and databases over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go model. Instead of owning infrastructure, companies rent it from providers like Azure.”

## 💻 What is Cloud Computing?

***👉 Easy Explanation:***
> Cloud computing is the process of using IT resources (like servers, storage, apps) over the internet instead of locally.

***👉 Industry Example:***
> Your company needs to host a website. Instead of buying servers, you use Azure App Service (PaaS) and deploy the site. Azure handles scaling, uptime, and security.

***👉 Key point to remember:***
> Cloud computing = using remote resources for speed, cost efficiency, and flexibility.

***👉 Interview Q: What is Cloud Computing?***
> Answer: “Cloud computing is delivering computing resources — such as servers, networking, databases, and software — over the internet. It helps businesses reduce upfront costs and scale easily.”

## 🔹 What is Azure?

***👉 Easy Explanation:***
> Azure is Microsoft’s cloud platform. It provides 200+ services: VMs, databases, AI, networking, security, DevOps tools.

***👉 Industry Example:***
> Banks use Azure for secure storage, startups use it to quickly launch apps, governments use it for scalability + compliance.

***👉 Key point to remember:***
> Azure = Microsoft’s public cloud, one of the top 3 (Azure, AWS, GCP).

***👉 Interview Q: What is Azure?***
> Answer: “Azure is Microsoft’s public cloud platform, offering 200+ services across compute, storage, networking, security, AI, and DevOps. It’s widely used for building, deploying, and managing apps and infrastructure.”

## 🌍 Cloud Models (Deployment Models)
***1. Public Cloud***

- Shared infrastructure managed by provider (Azure).

- Anyone can use it on pay-as-you-go.

- Example: Hosting a website on Azure App Service.

- Key Point: Most common, cheap, scalable.

***Interview Q: What is Public Cloud?***
> 👉 “Public cloud is owned and operated by third-party providers like Azure. Resources are shared among customers, but securely isolated. Example: deploying a VM in Azure East US.”

***2. Private Cloud***

- Infrastructure dedicated to one company.

- Either on-premises or hosted by vendor.

- Example: A bank builds its own cloud in its data center.

- Key Point: Expensive but high security & compliance.

***Interview Q: What is Private Cloud?***
> 👉 “Private cloud is used by a single organization, usually for compliance or security. Example: a hospital storing patient data on its private cloud.”

***3. Hybrid Cloud***

- Mix of Public + Private.

- Example: A company keeps sensitive data in private cloud, but uses Azure public cloud for web apps.

- Key Point: Best of both worlds, but complex to manage.

***Interview Q: What is Hybrid Cloud?***
> 👉 “Hybrid cloud combines private and public clouds to balance security with scalability. Example: A government keeps citizen data in private but uses Azure for web-facing apps.”
